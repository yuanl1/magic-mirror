# Alexa skills lambda request handler

## Installing dependencies and building
Run the following:

```shell
npm install
```

Package this folder as a zip (including node modules) and deploy to your lambda function as a zip file.

```shell
npm run build
```

This will create a builds/lambda.zip file which you can upload to the AWS lambda function.
